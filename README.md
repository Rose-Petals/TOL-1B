## 👩🏽‍💻 **Setup and Installation**

**Provide step-by-step instructions so someone else can run your code and reproduce your results. Depending on your setup, include:**

* How to clone the repository
* How to install dependencies
* How to set up the environment
* How to access the dataset(s)
* How to run the notebook or scripts

---

## 🏗️ **Project Overview**

**Describe:**

- How this project is connected to the Break Through Tech AI Program
- Your AI Studio host company and the project objective and scope
- The real-world significance of the problem and the potential impact of your work

---

## 📊 **Data Exploration**

**You might consider describing the following (as applicable):**

* The dataset(s) used: origin, format, size, type of data
* Data exploration and preprocessing approaches
* Insights from your Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Challenges and assumptions when working with the dataset(s)

**Statistical Analysis**
- We performed Chi-Squared Statistical Test between each feature variable and the target variable (appointment_time). 
- Using a significance level of 0.05 we determined the variables that were most associated with the client appointment time.
- The most associated variables are: 'intake_method', 'age', 'Medication_Management', 'Talk_Therapy'
- 'Medication_Management' and 'Talk_Therapy' are appointment types


**Visualizations:**
- Visualized the effects of the above variables on client appointment times
- Some of the most significant observations:

## 🧠 **Model Development**

**You might consider describing the following (as applicable):**

* Model(s) used (e.g., CNN with transfer learning, regression models)
* Feature selection and Hyperparameter tuning strategies
* Training setup (e.g., % of data for training/validation, evaluation metric, baseline performance)


---

## 📈 **Results & Key Findings**

**You might consider describing the following (as applicable):**

* Performance metrics (e.g., Accuracy, F1 score, RMSE)
* How your model performed
* Insights from evaluating model fairness

**Potential visualizations to include:**

* Confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, feature importance plot, prediction distribution, outputs from fairness or explainability tools
